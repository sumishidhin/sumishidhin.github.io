    	<p>Search engine optimization ensures your content is crawlable by search bots and formatted ideally for user consumption.
Fluffy, thin content is penalized for not meeting these SEO criteria, while comprehensive, relevant content is rewarded with higher rankings in SERPs.SEO is mandatory simply to get websites a foot in the door of SERPs, meaning structured data and technical site markup are bare-minimum techniques to exist in 2018.
But beyond these ground-floor practices, SEO is important for the value it adds to businesses’ bottom lines.

SEO is ROI.
More than 82 percent of marketers state their SEO effectiveness is increasing (i.e., search presence competition is more heated than ever). Another 61 percent report SEO is their top inbound marketing priority.

These trends make sense, as SEO is proven to generate:

More clicks: Searchers are 8.5X more likely to click on organic results than paid ads.
More traffic: SEO brings 85 percent more traffic to websites than PPC.
More purchases: Consumers are 131 percent more likely to purchase after reading a piece of content.
More leads: Inbound marketing produces 3X more leads than outbound.
More conversions: Content marketing prompts 6X more conversions than traditional marketing.
More visibility: Companies with updated, optimized content have 434 percent more search-indexed pages.
Of equal importance is understanding how both on- and off-page SEO factor into the effectiveness of your content.</p>

               <summary><h4>Content optimization priorities</h4></summary>
                <p>
                	<h3>Where to start and what to do</h3>
                	<p>When optimizing content, you should optimize the entire page for a single keyword.

Yes, secondary and Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) keywords will play a role, but it needs to be absolutely clear to search engines and consumers what your page (blog) is about and how relevant it is to the topic, its title, subheads and metatags. To do that, laser-focus on an individual keyword.
(For this very post, ours is “website content optimization,” so we’re attempting to tackle this topic from all logical angles. Additionally, long-tail keywords that are three to four words long tend to be the best targets.)
</p>
<h3>Pinpoint pages for improvement</h3>
<p>To start, use Google Search Console/Moz Keyword Explorer to determine pages that are already on the cusp of ranking on page one for a given keyword. (You can choose any page, really, but the quickest way to see tangible ranking improvements is to focus first on pages that already perform reasonably well and just need a small shove across the SERP goal line.)

Say, for instance, you currently rank in position 12 for “content strategy consulting.” This means you likely need to jump just two more positions to appear on page one, which is where 90 percent or more of all clicks occur.Provided your page is properly marked up on the backend and all metadata is keyword relevant, you’ll need to update the depth of your copy. We call this “content depth.”</p>
<h3>Perform a content depth audit</h3>
<p>Essentially, your blogs aren’t ranking as well as they could be because there are certain gaps within your content that other companies are exploiting. They are covering topics more thoroughly than you are, so of course Google correlates their posts with better value for users.

A content gap analysis reveals the ideas you need to include in your updated copy to better serve searcher intent. It’s a step-by-step blueprint for what to keep and what to change.

With these newly uncovered ideas, you need to write each of them methodically enough to add value to the reader: No skimping or glossing over important aspects of the keyword.

Plus, these ideas must flow well into the larger narrative and be relevant to the root keyword you’re targeting. In most cases, this means expanding content length by several hundred or even a thousand words – Yes, that’s what’s required to rank today.</p>

<h3>Consider additional on-page elements</h3>
<p>Once the copy is written, another way to optimize the page is to include custom imagery, social share buttons, logical CTAs and appropriate subheadings to break up the text into a more easily consumable format. You may also want to embed social media elements like Instagram photos or tweets for additional context.

To reap the rewards of such a strategy, you don’t need to change existing metadata (title tags and URLs, specifically). Simply open the old post within your CMS, make content changes directly, then republish.

As you go down the line optimizing subsequent posts, you can dive deeper into pages that aren’t performing well at all, with the ultimate goal being to enhance as many posts as possible.

Every piece of content holds inherent value. After all, you devoted resources to create it in the first place. Your job is only half complete, however, if you let that content stew on page 3 (or worse!) for years. Circle back to it, optimize and track performance metrics.

              <summary><h4>Website content optimization tools to use</h4></summary>
              <p>In theory, any SEO marketing tool (or plugin) should be able to clue you in on what to optimize and how to do it. Those tools may include:

Ahrefs.
Moz.
SEMrush.
Searchmetrics.
Raven Tools.
Yoast SEO.
Optimizely.
At Brafton, we, for certain applications, use all of the above.

In practice, we’ve found the most efficient and cost-effective optimization tools to be MarketMuse and trusty ol’ Google Search Console.

These tools provide the exact data we need, actionable takeaways on what to improve and the likelihood of us outperforming others once content updates are made.

Find a tool that suits your vision and fits your budget.</p>
